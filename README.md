# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project had to do with taking a .txt file containing a list of grocery items and executing a four options. Option one is to count the frequency of a word the user inputs. Option 2 is to print a list of all items and their frequencies. Option 3 is to pring a Histogram using asterisks and lastly, option four is to exit the program. 

# What did you do particularly well?
I think the function that counts the frequency of items works really well. 


# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?


# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?


# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?


# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
