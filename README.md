# Cplusplus-Program-
# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project had to do with taking a .txt file containing a list of grocery items and executing a four options. Option one is to count the frequency of a word the user inputs. Option 2 is to print a list of all items and their frequencies. Option 3 is to pring a Histogram using asterisks and lastly, option four is to exit the program. 

# What did you do particularly well?
I think the function that counts the frequency of items works really well. Also the way the functions are incorporated throughout the code work well.


# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Add an error message to guide user in case there is an invalid input or file errors. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most complicated part of the code was handling file input/output operations because there could be error handling, managing file streams, and ensuring proper resource cleanup. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The project involves working with data structures like maps (for storing word-frequency pairs) and implementing algorithms for counting frequencies and generating histograms. Understanding and applying data structures and algorithms are fundamental skills applicable to many areas of computer science, including data analysis, artificial intelligence, and software engineering. Handling file input/output operations is a common task in software development. The experience gained from reading from and writing to files in this project can be applied to other projects involving data persistence, logging, or interacting with external resources.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The program's maintainability, readability, and adaptability stem from its modular design, descriptive naming, and comprehensive documentation. Through encapsulation and error handling, it ensures robustness and ease of maintenance. Its adaptable menu system and consistent coding style further contribute to its versatility and usability across various contexts.
